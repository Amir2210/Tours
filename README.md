🎋 Intro:
This project is a React web application that fetches tour data from an external API and displays it to the user. Users can view a list of available tours, remove tours they're not interested in, and refresh the list to see the latest data.

📦 Tech Stack:

React
JavaScript (ES6+)
HTML
CSS
👩🏽‍🍳 Features:

Fetches tour data from an external API.
Displays a list of tours with information such as name, image, price, and description.
Allows users to remove tours they're not interested in.
Provides a "refresh" button to update the list with the latest data from the API.
💭 Process:
The project started with setting up a React environment and fetching data from the API. I focused on designing components for displaying tours and handling user interactions. While implementing features, I encountered challenges such as managing loading states and updating tour lists dynamically. Through experimentation and research, I resolved these issues and gained a deeper understanding of React's useEffect hook and state management. Overall, the project provided valuable insights into building responsive web applications with React.

📚 Learnings:

Enhanced understanding of React hooks, including useState and useEffect.
Improved knowledge of asynchronous JavaScript and handling API requests.
Practiced building reusable React components for displaying data.
✨ Improvement:

Implement pagination for better handling of large datasets.
Enhance error handling for failed API requests.
Improve styling for a more visually appealing user interface.
